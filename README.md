# 🚀 Quantum-AI Ops Dashboard

A futuristic, high-efficiency dashboard interface designed to showcase advanced CSS layouts and the "AI-to-UI" speed workflow.

## 💡 The "AI-to-UI" Speed Hack
This project was built in **30 minutes** using an AI-orchestrated workflow. By moving away from manual "grind" coding, I focused on:
- **Architectural Prompting:** Using AI to scaffold complex CSS Grid areas.
- **Visual Optimization:** Rapidly iterating on glassmorphic effects and responsive breakpoints.
- **Efficiency:** Reducing development time by 90% without sacrificing code quality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Advanced Grid, Flexbox, and Glassmorphism.
- **AI Toolings:[ Gemini/ChatGPT] for layout orchestration.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Responsive Layout:** Perfectly aligned from mobile to 4K monitors.
- **Glassmorphic UI:** Modern "frosted glass" aesthetic for an AI-centric feel.
- **Performance Metrics:** Simulated live-tracking cards for AI agent monitoring.

## 📂 How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/jaanvii-panch08/ai-performance-dashboard`
